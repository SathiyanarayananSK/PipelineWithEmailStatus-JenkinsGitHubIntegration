# 🚀 Jenkins Pipeline with GitHub Integration  

Welcome to the **Jenkins Pipeline with GitHub Integration** project! This repository demonstrates how to set up a fully automated CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, integrated seamlessly with GitHub. With this project, I've applied industry best practices to streamline software development and deployment workflows.  

## 🌟 Highlights  

- **Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD):** Automates building, testing, and deploying applications with ease.  
- **Integrated Email Notifications:** Keep your team informed in real-time about build statuses, test results, and deployment events.  
- **Multi-Stage Pipeline:** Includes comprehensive stages for building, testing, analyzing, and deploying code.     

## 🛠️ Project Stages  

Here's a snapshot of the stages implemented in this pipeline (Just the idea - Not the actual implementation):  

1. **🔨 Build**: Compiles and packages the application using Maven.  
2. **🧪 Unit & Integration Testing**: Runs automated tests with JUnit and Selenium.  
3. **📊 Code Quality Analysis**: Ensures high standards with SonarQube.  
4. **🔒 Security Scan**: Identifies vulnerabilities using OWASP ZAP.  
5. **📦 Staging Deployment**: Deploys the application to a staging environment on AWS EC2.  
6. **🛠️ Integration Tests on Staging**: Validates functionality in the staging environment.  
7. **🚢 Production Deployment**: Deploys the application to the production server on AWS EC2.
